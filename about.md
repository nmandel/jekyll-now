I am a software developer whose latest project, [Icecomm.io](http://icecomm.io) - a developer platform for WebRTC - reached #2 on Hacker News, as well as the front page of Product Hunt and /r/programming. I build coding projects (both on teams and as a solo developer) primarily using Javascript and its many related technologies. 

I'm currently seeking a full-stack developer position in the Greater Seattle area; for more information, check out [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nrmandel).
